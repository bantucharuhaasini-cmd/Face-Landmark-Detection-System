#  Face Landmark Detection System

## 📌 Overview

The Face Landmark Detection System is a Computer Vision application that detects human faces in uploaded images and identifies important facial landmarks such as:

* 👁 Left Eye
* 👁 Right Eye
* 👃 Nose
* 👄 Mouth

The application uses OpenCV for face detection and MediaPipe Face Mesh for facial landmark localization. A bounding box is drawn around each detected face, and key landmarks are highlighted on the image.

## 🌐 Live Demo

The application is deployed using Streamlit Community Cloud.
